# Virtual Assistant Project

## Introduction

This Python project creates a simple virtual assistant that can perform various tasks based on voice commands. It uses several libraries, including `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `datetime`, `pywhatkit`, `wikipedia`, `pyjokes`, `random`, `webbrowser`, `winshell`, and `os`, to provide a range of functionalities. I've learned to build this project from different sources such as Geeksforgeeks and Youtube, while also adding my own functions.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: The assistant listens to voice commands and converts them into text.
- **Open browsers and applications**: It can help opening browsers and apps like Google Chrome, Excel, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Pycharm,...
- **Text-to-Speech**: It can respond to user commands by converting text into speech.
- **Music Playback**: Play music on YouTube using the `play` command.
- **Time and Date**: Retrieve the current time and date on command.
- **Conversation**: Engage in simple conversation, including greeting and asking about well-being.
- **Wikipedia Search**: Retrieve information from Wikipedia.
- **Application and Website Opening**: Open various applications and websites.
- **Recycle Bin**: Clear the recycle bin with a voice command.
- **Jokes**: Tell jokes using the `joke` command.
- **Quit**: Stop the virtual assistant using the `stop` command.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python virtual_assistant.py

## Usage

Start speaking your commands with "Alexa" followed by the desired action.

## Configuration

You can customize the virtual assistant's name by changing the `botName` variable in the script.
